This repository provides a code snippet demonstrating how to delete a batch test from Applitools by targeting a ```batchId```.

The snippet requires certain environment variables to be set. 
- APPLITOOLS_API_KEY: can be found once you log in to Applitools
- APPLITOOLS_SERVER_URL: https://sherwineyes.applitools.com

It is important to note that when authenticating in Applitools, X-Eyes-Api-Key must be added to the header. You can find more info [here](https://applitools.com/docs/api-ref/server-api/authentication/)
